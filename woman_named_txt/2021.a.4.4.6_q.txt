This man wrote a romanticized account of the Covenanters victory at Loudon Hill in his novel Old Mortality. The lynching of the title man in the historical Porteous  Riots in Edinburgh acts as the backdrop for this man's novel,  The Heart of the Midlothian. In another novel by this man, the title Anglo-Saxon pretends to be the Spanish knight Desdichado to win a  tournament presided over by King John. Rowena is married to the title knight at the behest of Richard the Lionheart in, for ten points, what author's novel Ivanhoe?
