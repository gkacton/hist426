This author cast the Duke of Guise  as a villain in his play The Massacre at Paris. The assassin Lightborn kills the title character of a play by this man that opens with the recall of that kingâ€™s favorite,  Piers Gaveston, from exile. The title character of another of his plays keeps the sultan Bajazeth in a cage and burns a Koran after conquering Babylon. This author of  Edward II and Tamburlaine the Great also had the ghost of Machiavelli deliver the prologue to his play The Jew of Malta. For 10 points, name this Elizabethan author who was stabbed by Ingram Frizer, possibly for spying.
