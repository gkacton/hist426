A 2010 redesign of this item removed the initials “VDB” from its front for the second time. During World War Two, these items were subject to a discoloring redox reaction when the chemistry-unaware Henry Morgenthau  authorized the addition of zinc to them. As a result, one of the most valuable examples of these items is the 1944 “steel wheat” variety. Since 2010 these items display a shield reading “e pluribus unum.” For ten points, name these coins which show Abraham Lincoln on the front.
