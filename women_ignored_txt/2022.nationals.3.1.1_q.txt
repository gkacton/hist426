The completion of this project was celebrated with the first ticker-tape parade held in New York City. Originally planned as a lighthouse on the Suez Canal, this project was built on an exclave called Bedloe's Island and rests on steel infrastructure designed by Gustave Eiffel. A broken chain lies at the feet of this sculpture, whose title figure holds a tablet in her left arm. Designed by Frederic Bartholdi, for ten points, what is this colossal sculpture of a crowned woman holding a torch in New York Harbor?
