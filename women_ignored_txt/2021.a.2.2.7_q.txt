Jimmy Claxton was perhaps the first person to successfully breach this regulation despite being promptly fired a week later. After speculation that Armando Marsans and Rafael Almeida broke this regulation, managers assured the public that "they were as pure white as Castile soap." Branch Rickey and Bill Veeck both attempted to break this regulation, which was successfully broken when both Larry Doby and another player appeared on rosters. Jackie Robinson was the first player to break, for ten points, what regulation in Major League Baseball?
