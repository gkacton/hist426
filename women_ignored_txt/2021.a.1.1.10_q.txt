At the behest of Eugene Reybold, a project focused on this river employed a number of Camp Clinton-housed prisoners from the German Afrika Korps. A series of levees were built along this river in the aftermath of an event that bolstered Huey Long’s gubernatorial campaign and resulted in Herbert Hoover leading a series of relief operations. That piece of legislation also mandated the creation of the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway along this river. For ten points, name this major American river that experienced a “great” 1927 flood.
