Tom Clark once commissioned a list of 12,000 disloyal citizens from this man. This man first led the "Radical Division" during the Palmer Raids and had a public dispute with T.R.M. Howard over the lethargic  police response to Southern lynchings. Starting in 1956, this man authorized a wide-ranging program of partially illegal infiltration and disinformation called  COINTELPRO , which targeted the Black Panthers and Martin Luther King. For ten points, name this man who served from 1924 to his 1972 death as the director of the FBI and its precursors.
