NASA’s future missions include launching the Dragonfly spacecraft to a feature of this celestial body to investigate its possible habitability. One of this planet’s moons was determined to be habitable after the Cassini space probe found evidence of geysers. An anagram that describes a feature of this planet as a “thin, flat ring” was published by Christian Huygens  in 1655. In 1610, Galileo Galilei observed the extensive ring system of, for ten points, what gas giant, the second largest planet in the solar system?
