These things were first theorized by George Johnston Stoney as a “fundamental unit quantity of electricity.” A theory created by John Dalton depicts the water molecule without these particles while a model created by Erwin Schrödinger presents these particles as “matter waves.” Robert A. Millikan’s oil drop experiment was successful in measuring the charge of this particle. Discovered in 1897 by British physicist J. J. Thomson, for ten points, what is this negatively charged particle integral to quantum physics?
