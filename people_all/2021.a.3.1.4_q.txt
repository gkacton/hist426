In a failed attempt to prevent this event, a route along Appel Quay was decided upon by Oskar Potiorek. A false turn by Leopold Lojka  resulted in this event, which was preceded by a failed attack with a hand grenade. An FN Model 1910 was used to carry out this attack, which also resulted in the death of its central targetâ€™s wife, Sophie. The Black Hand helped organize this event, which was perpetrated by the Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip. For ten points, name this 1914 attack that killed the heir presumptive of Austria-Hungary.
