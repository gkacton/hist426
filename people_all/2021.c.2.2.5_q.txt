This island's Sette Giugno  holiday commemorates a British massacre of Italian irredentists. It's not Rhodes, but King George VI  awarded this entire island the George Cross after it resisted Axis bombing campaigns. The image of Ottoman invincibility was shattered after the Knights Hospitaller successfully defended this island in 1565. Jean Parisot de Valette  names the capital of, for ten points, what small island nation to the south of Sicily?
