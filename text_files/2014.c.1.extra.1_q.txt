Because two million acres in this American state were set aside for veterans, the land became known as the "Military Tract" and towns there were named Pompey, Solon, and Scipio. This state's "burned-over district" was the center of the Second Great Awakening, and its city of Cooperstown became the home of the Baseball Hall of Fame due to an erroneous belief that the game was invented there. For 10 points, name this home of the Finger Lakes and Buffalo.
