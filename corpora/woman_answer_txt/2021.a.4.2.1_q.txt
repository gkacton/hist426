This president repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, citing it was "no longer appropriate." This president signed a law mandating background checks on firearms purchases, the Brady Bill, and dealt with "Troopergate" when several officers from his home state alleged they had arranged romantic liaisons for him. This president's Whitewater scandals merged with another scandal in which he claimed to have not had "sexual relations with that woman." For ten points, name this Democratic president during the 1990s who was impeached for perjury for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
