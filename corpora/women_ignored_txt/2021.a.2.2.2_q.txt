This country's first president was Gr√©goire Kayibanda, who persecuted an ethnic group known for its cattle-herding. Under his successor, the RTLM radio station and Kangura magazine incited hatred towards that group in this country, referring to them as "tall trees" to be cut down. After its president's plane was shot down in 1994, this country suffered a series of massacres until Paul Kagame's  "Patriotic Front" seized control of the government. For ten points, name this country where a genocide occurred against the Tutsi people.
