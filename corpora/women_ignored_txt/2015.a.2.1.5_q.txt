The English chemist John Mayow predicted the existence of this element upon observing that antimony increased in weight when heated. This element reacted to produce banded-iron formations before its rise in atmospheric abundance. It was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1773 and later by Joseph Priestley in 1774. For 10 points, name this element whose diatomic form is “dephlogisticated” air, the second-most abundant atmospheric gas.
