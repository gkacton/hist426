In a poem in this language, three cowardly brothers flee from a battle, one riding on his own lord's horse. That poem has been the subject of translation controversies of the word "ofermode," meaning "pride" or "arrogance." Historical  texts in this language, including one that describes the sea as a "whale-road," feature compound metaphors called "kennings." A 1731 fire partially destroyed the Nowell Codex, which contains a poem in this language about a prince of the Geats.  For ten points, name this language of the poems "The Battle of Maldon" and Beowulf.
