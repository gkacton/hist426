One composer from this modern-day country used a "sacred minimalist" sound that is exemplified by his Symphony of Sorrowful Songs and the  Copernican Symphony. Another composer from this country wrote a series of pieces based on music from this country, including mazurkas and polonaises, though he is best known for his études and the Minute Waltz.  For ten points, name this home country of Henryk Górecki and Frédéric Chopin , who was born in the Duchy of Warsaw.
