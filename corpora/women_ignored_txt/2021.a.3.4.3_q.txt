A passage in Pliny says that an important statue of this god had wool binding around the feet and was hollowed out and filled with oil that was removed only once per year. A fresco discovered at Pompeii shows this god wearing a white veil and carrying a  sickle. This god, whom the Romans believes patronized an archaic Golden Age in Italy, was the namesake of a winter  festival during which masters waited on slaves. For ten points, identify this father of Jupiter who the Romans worshipped at a cult center on the Capitoline hill.
