A composer from this musical era, Heinrich Biber , called for strings to play col legno to evoke the sounds of battle in the opening of Battalia. Another composer from this era, who wrote the music for The Bourgeois Gentleman, died by stabbing himself with a conducting staff. The all-female ensemble of the Ospedale Della Pieta orphanage often sang music by a composer from this era who wrote four concerti grossi depicting changing weather throughout the year. For ten points, name this classical music era of Jean-Baptiste Lully, Antonio Vivaldi, and Johann Sebastian Bach.
