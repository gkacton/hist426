This U.S. state's first European settlement was the failed Spanish Jesuit Ajac√°n  Mission. This colony's Treaty of 1677 allowed several tribes such as the Nottaway and the Saponi to keep and bear arms, so long as they maintained loyalty to the English Crown. A group of enslaved Africans were brought to this colony's Old Point Comfort in 1619. For ten points, name this state, the first colony in which was established by travelers on the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and the Discovery at Jamestown in 1607.
