Now a National Park, this location contains the Red Shirt Table, named after a leader of the Ghost Dance Movement. Under the Mission 66 Plan, the Ben Reifel Visitor Center was built at this place, which was given to the Oglala in perpetuity in the later-broken Second Treaty of Fort  Laramie. The "Stronghold District" in this area was seized during World War Two for use as a firing range.  For ten points, name this Sioux-populated National Park that contains the United States's largest undisturbed mixed-grass prairie.
