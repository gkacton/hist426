This man's book, The Truth, was plagiarized from John Humphrey Noyes. This man told the jury that convicted him that they were "low, consummate jackasses." This person's speech against Winfield Scott Hancock was not taken seriously by Republicans in the 1880 election. He reportedly shouted "I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts" when killing a man at a Washington D.C. railroad station. For 10 points, name this assassin who killed President James Garfield.
