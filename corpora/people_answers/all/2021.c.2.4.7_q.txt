Alongside Pompeii, a city bearing the name of this figure was partially preserved under the ash from the eruption of Mount  Vesuvius. Brandishing a lion skin pelt, the Roman emperor Commodus  often dressed as this mythic figure during his gladiatorial fights.  For ten points, name this Roman demi-god and son of Jupiter, known for his immense strength.
