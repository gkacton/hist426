Nancy Pelosi tried to invoke a little-known section of this amendment that disqualifies people for office on the basis of insurrection. Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that this amendment “does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s Social Statics” in the case Lochner v. New York. It's not the Fifth Amendment, but this amendment’s Due Process Clause was used to apply the Bill of Rights to states. Griswold v. Connecticut held that this amendment established a “right to privacy." For ten points, name this Constitutional amendment that established the Equal Protection Clause.
