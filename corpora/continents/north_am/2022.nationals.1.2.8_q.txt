This war was declared by one side in part due to a wave of negative publicity toward the concentration camps overseen by a commander known as "Butcher" Weyler. Leonard Wood commanded one unit during an assault on Kettle Hill during this conflict, though he was overshadowed by his second-in-command, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy. For ten points, name this late nineteenth century war during which the Rough Riders captured San Juan Hill, part of a campaign to take Puerto Rico from a European power.
