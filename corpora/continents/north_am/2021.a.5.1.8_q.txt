In 1946, the Soviet Union prevented a production of this work "on the grounds that the drama  inspire a  suicide wave." This play was first performed at McCarter Theatre in New Jersey before transferring to Broadway, where Edward Albee hailed it as “the greatest American play ever written.” Told in three acts, this metatheatrical play features an omniscient stage manager who oversees the performance and is set in Grover's Corners, a "typical American community." For ten points, name this play by Thornton Wilder, which earned him his first Pulitzer Prize for Drama.
