This man was sidelined for two weeks in a campaign after he hurt his knee on a car door. This man foolishly promised to visit every state in an election he lost. He declined an investigation into voting fraud perpetrated by Richard Daley in Illinois, effectively conceding a close national race. For 10 points, name this sitting vice president and Republican who lost the 1960 presidential election to John F. Kennedy.
