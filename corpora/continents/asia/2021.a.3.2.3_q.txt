The explosion of a water tank in Mayak led to a nuclear disaster in the southern portion of this range, irradiating nearby Lake Karachay. A city nestled in this range named Magnitogorsk became an industrial hub in the 1930s due to a mountain there being made up of fifty-five percent iron ore. The Council for Evacuation, or GKO, moved over 1500 factories beyond this mountain range in the midst of Operation Barbarossa. For ten points, name this mountain range that historically divided the European and Asian portions of Russia.
