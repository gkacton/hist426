A portion of this piece's manuscript that contained the words "Quam olim da capo" was stolen at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. A bass soloist sings the same melody of an arpeggiated B-flat major trombone solo in this piece's "Tuba Mirum." The wife of this piece's composer, Constanze , kept quiet about the role of Franz Xaver SÃ¼ssmayr  in completing its "Lacrimosa" that was left mostly unfinished after its composer's 1791 death. For ten points, name this mass for the dead by the composer of The Magic Flute.
