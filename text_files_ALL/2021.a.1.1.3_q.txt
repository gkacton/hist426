According to Marco Polo, a ruler of this city was locked in his treasure room without food or water for neglecting to spend his gold on the city’s defense. That ruler of this city, Al-Musta’sim [[al-moo-stah-SEEM]], legendarily died after being rolled in a carpet and trampled to death by an invader’s horses. Harun al-Rashid built a library in this city, which was destroyed in a 1258 siege by Hulagu [[hoo-LAH-goo]] Khan. For ten points, name this city which contained a “House of Wisdom” before becoming the capital of modern-day Iraq.
