Using an aquarium, filmmaker Georges Méliès [[mel-YAY]] simulated exploring this ship's wreckage in a 19th century silent short film. The 1898 Del Peral [[peh-RAHL]] Inquiry found that this ship's demise was not caused by hitting a mine. In an example of "yellow journalism," this ship's name was rhymed with the phrase "To Hell with Spain" by the U.S. press. For ten points, name this cruiser whose sinking in Havana Harbor was an impetus for the Spanish-American War.
