Fossils of this species were first found in the Engis Caves of Belgium, though they get their name from subsequent finds on the outskirts of Dusseldorf in a namesake  valley. This species was once believed to have been rendered extinct by bands of rock-throwing predators, though it is now known from DNA markers that they  interbred with the ancestors of modern humans. For 10 points, name this large-skulled hominid which survived in Europe until 40,000 BC.
