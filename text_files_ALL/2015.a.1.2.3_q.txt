This play included a scene in which a character is told “Thou shalt get kings” to please its author’s patron, James I. The heir Donalbain [DONN-ull-bane] goes into hiding during this play, whose title character is killed after Birnam Wood is brought to Dunsinane [DUNN-sinn-ane]. The three Weird Sisters appear in, for 10 points, what Shakespeare play, which culminates with Macduff slaying the title Scottish king?
