This non-Christian deity is Vasco da Gama's main supernatural helper in the Portuguese epic, the Lusiads. In Ovid's Metamorphoses, this deity begs Jupiter to turn the murdered Julius Caesar into a star, since the historical Julii (pr. JOO-lee-ee) clan claimed descent from her. In another foundation myth, she presents a shield depicting future Roman history to her son, which she had requested from her husband Vulcan. For 10 points, name this mother of Aeneas, the Roman goddess of love.
