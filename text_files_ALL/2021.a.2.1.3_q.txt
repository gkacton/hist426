The first engagement in this war began in Wallachia at the Battle of Oltenita. This war's Danubian phase ended when Omar Pasha defeated Prince Gorchakov at Silistria. In one battle in this war, only the ship Taif [[TAH-eef]] escaped an attack by Pavel Nakhimov at Sinope [[SIH-noh-pee]]. This war included battles at Malakoff redoubt and the Great Redan by French and British forces as part of the Siege of Sevastopol, an effort to capture the Tsar's Black Sea Fleet. For ten points, name this 1853 to 1856 war between Russia and an Ottoman-European coalition.
