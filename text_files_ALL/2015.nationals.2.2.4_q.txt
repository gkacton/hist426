Plutarch's first pair of Lives parallel this mythical figure with Romulus for their roles in founding cities. This victor over the Pallantidae volunteered for a contest held in honor of the dead boy Androgeus. In another story, this son and successor of Aegeus fled the island of Naxos while his lover was still sleeping there; this man had previously received a golden thread from that lover, Ariadne. For 10 points, name this mythical king of Athens who slew the Minotaur.
