This man starred in a series of commercials for Paul Masson [[mah-SOHN]] with the slogan "We will sell no wine before its time." This man was infamously angered while recording a commercial for Findus frozen peas. In one film, a character played by this man erroneously states at the Vienna Riesenrad [[REE-zen-rahd]] that the Swiss had "five hundred years of democracy and peace" and produced only the cuckoo clock. For ten points, name this actor who portrayed Harry Lime in The Third Man and wrote and starred in Citizen Kane.
