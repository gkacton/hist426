One hoax involving this event was the made-up shooting of Martin Šmíd [[SHMEED]] by police. Protesters during this event jingled keys to signify the unlocking of doors when Miloš Jakeš [[MEE-lohsh YAH-kehsh]] resigned as General Secretary. This event began on International Students' Day and ended when Gustáv Husák resigned and was replaced with the leader of the Charter 77 movement, Václav Havel. For ten points, name this revolution in 1989 that culminated with the ending of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.
