An early lyric by this group parodies the nativist views of Enoch Powell and demands that immigrants return to their “commonwealth homes.” This group's members took an illfated trip to Rishikesh [[ree-shee-KESH]] for a guided meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. A member of this group left that course early to film the documentary Raga about his sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar. For ten points, name this influential band of the British Invasion whose songs “Get Back” and “Norwegian Wood” were credited to John Lennon and Paul McCartney.
