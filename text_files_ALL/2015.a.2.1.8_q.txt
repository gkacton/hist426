The early Christian thinker Tertullian [turr-TOOL-ee-uhn] asked “what has (this city) to do with Jerusalem?” The royal stoa [STOH-uh] of Attalos [uh-TALL-ohs] is found in this city. Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate was copied from a large gate to a landmark in this city called the Propylaea [pro-pull-AYE-uh]. The explosion of an Ottoman munitions dump damaged this city's most famous landmark, from which a set of marble sculptures were removed by Lord Elgin. For 10 points, name this European capital city in which the Parthenon [PAR-thuh-nonn] can be found on the Acropolis [uh-CROP-uh-luhs].
