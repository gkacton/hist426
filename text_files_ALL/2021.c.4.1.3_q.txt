In the Life of Saint Boniface, the title saint cuts down a tree sacred to this non-Roman deity in Hesse [[HEH-suh]]. In his treatise Germania, Tacitus [[TASS-ih-tuss]] referred to this god as the "Hercules" of the Suebi [[SWAY-bee]] people, while "Mercury" was the equivalent of Odin. In opposition to the Christianization of Scandinavia, many believers wore charms depicting this god's hammer Mj√∂lnir [[MYOHL-neer]]. For ten points, name this widely-worshipped red-headed Norse god of thunder.
