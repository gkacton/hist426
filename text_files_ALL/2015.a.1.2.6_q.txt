One type of these objects was called a penteconter [PEN-tuh-conn-tur]. A device called the corvus was first used on these objects at the Battle of Mylae [MEE-lay]. These objects were targeted by a claw and a death ray supposedly invented by Archimedes. The trireme [TRY-reem] was a type of this vehicle. For 10 points, name this kind of vehicle, which in the ancient world were often powered by galley slaves with oars.
