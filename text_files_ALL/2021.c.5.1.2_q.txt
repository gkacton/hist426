Johann Wolfgang DÃ¶bereiner [[DUH-buh-"rye"-nuh]] named a set of triads in an early formulation of this display. John Newlands attempted to create this display, which was inspired by the observations of Lothar Meyer. Some members of this diagram were originally prefixed "eka-," and this diagram once contained entries such as coronium and aether. Containing components like hydrogen and helium, for ten points, what diagram, developed by Dmitri Mendeleev [[men-deh-LEY-eff]], organizes the chemical elements?
