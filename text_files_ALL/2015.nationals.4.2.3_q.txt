This event was preceded by the Address of the 221. It was prompted by the publishing in “Le Moniteur” of the Ordinances of St. Cloud, which dissolved the Chamber of Deputies. An appeal to Jules de Polignac (pr. pole-en-YACK) failed during this event, which took place during the “Three Glorious Days.” It saw the capture of the Hotel de Ville and the creation of barricades. For 10 points, name this event in France which saw replacement of Charles X with Louis Philippe.
