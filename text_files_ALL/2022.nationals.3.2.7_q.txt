One commander at this battle, Ariabignes [[ah-ree-ah-BIG-nees]], was allegedly speared to death by Socles and Ameinias [[ah-MEY-nee-ahss]]. A deceptive message lured one side to the site of this battle, in which the playwright of Prometheus Bound, Aeschylus [[EH-skih-luss]], participated. Prior to this battle, one side lost over one-third of its ships in a storm near Magnesia. Eurybiades [[yoo-rih-BYE-ah-dees]] assisted the winning commander at this 480 BCE battle fought in a set of namesake straits. For ten points, name this victory for Themistocles over the navy of Xerxes.
