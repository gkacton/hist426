According to Herodotus [heh-ROD-uh-tuss], the earliest usage of these things occurred under the rule of Alyattes [ahl-YAH-tees] in Lydia, where they were made with electrum. The solidus was one of these items whose usage was introduced by Diocletian [dye-oh-CLEE-shun]. The field of numismatics studies these objects, which in the Roman Empire included asses, sestertii [sess-TER-shee], and denarii. For 10 points, identify these typically round, metal objects used as currency.
