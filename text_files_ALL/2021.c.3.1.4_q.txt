This structure's "Robber's Tunnel" was likely resealed during the Ramesside Restoration, one of many ancient sites refurbished by the sitting government. At the foot of this structure is a preserved solar barque [[BARK]] known as Khufu's Ship. First built in the 26th Century BC, this building stood as the tallest structure in the world until the construction of the Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. For ten points, name this Egyptian tomb and "Ancient Wonder of the World."
