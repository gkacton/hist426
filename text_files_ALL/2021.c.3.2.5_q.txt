Cicero [[SIH-seh-roh]] called this city's general Epaminondas [[eh-pah-mih-NAHN-duss]], who fell at the Battle of Mantinea [[mahn-tih-NEH-ah]], the "First Man of Greece." Until their defeat at Chaeronea [[kay-roh-NAY-uh]], a unit of 300 male lovers called the Sacred Band defended this city. This city-state, which was legendarily founded by Cadmus, was fought over by the two sons of Oedipus in Seven Against [this city]. For ten points, name this Boeotian [[boe-EE-shuhn]] city-state which shares its name with an ancient Egyptian capital.
