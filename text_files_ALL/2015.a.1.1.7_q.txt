This man described Monck Mason’s miraculous three-day trip across the Atlantic in a balloon in a hoax article printed in the New York Sun. In a story by this man, an imprisoned man rubs rancid meat on his tied up hands and is saved from death by rats, and later again by Napoleon’s General Lasalle [luh-sall]. He wrote a story whose narrator murders an old man with a “vulturelike” eye and confesses after hearing a sound from underneath the floorboards.
