Defying the governor of Cuba's return order, this man burned his own ships upon landing near modern-day Veracruz. Chroniclers report this man was mistaken for the god Quetzalcoatl [[KET-zahl-KWAH-til]], and he captured the city of Tenochtitlan [[teh-nohtch-teet-LAHN]] following the death of Moctezuma II.
