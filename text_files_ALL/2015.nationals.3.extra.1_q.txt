This civilization's people were the first to expect a drab underworld called Irkalla after death. This civilization produced a gold lyre with a sculpted bull's head near the base, which was found at a site once ruled by Queen Puabi that was excavated by Leonard (+) Woolley. During the 1500s BC, a "kings list" of these people was written in a wedge-andstylus (*) script that the Akkadians later used, known now as cuneiform (pr. cune-AY-if-form). For 10 points, name this civilization which built the ziggurat at Ur, the earliest major Mesopotamian civilization to build city-states.
