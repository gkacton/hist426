This author wrote of a colonel serving Queen Anne in The History of Henry Esmond and of an Irishman who fights in the Seven Years’ War and the American Revolution in The Luck of Barry Lyndon. Another of his novels opens at Miss Pinkerton’s Academy and contrasts the manipulative Becky Sharp with the naïve Amelia Sedley. For 10 points, name this Victorian author of Vanity Fair.
