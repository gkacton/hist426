This river was originally termed the "River of Good Omens" by Vasco da Gama, though it was quickly re-dubbed the Cuama [[KWAH-muh]]. The Caprivi [[kah-PREEvee]] Strip in (+) Namibia was created to give the German Empire access to this river during the Scramble for Africa. This river was first charted by David Livingstone, who traversed its course to Victoria Falls. (*) Once occupied by the Mutapa [[moo-TAH-pah]] Empire, for ten points, what fourth-longest river in Africa today provides the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe?
