A building named for this man had to sand down panels on the Founders Room to avoid concentrating sunlight on nearby residences. Acoustic designers Minoru Nagata and Yasuhisa Toyota created the interior of that building named for this man, whose exterior architecture was designed by Frank Gehry and which is the home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Another complex named after this man contains long-running sections such as Critter Country, Adventureland, and Main Street U.S.A. For ten points, identify this animator and namesake of "Land" and "World" theme park complexes in California and Florida.
