Friedrich Miescher [[MEE-shuh]] first identified this molecule in 1869, calling it nuclein. Helicases create a "fork" during the replication of this molecule, whose structure was identified thanks to Rosalind Franklin's Photo 51. For ten points, name this molecule that is often sequenced, best identified by its double-helix structure documented by Watson and Crick.
