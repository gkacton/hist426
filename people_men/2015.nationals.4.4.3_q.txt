He sang “we gave her everything we owned just to sit at her  table” in a song critical of the Maharishi, “Sexy Sadie.” During his honeymoon, he staged a “bed-in” in protest of the  Vietnam War, and he was murdered three weeks after releasing Double Fantasy by a man upset that he once called his band “bigger than Jesus,” Mark David Chapman.
